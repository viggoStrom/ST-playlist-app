[X] confirm if you wanna close the app
[X] fix single quotes in file names and PS UI by escaping it with ' so "future's end" -> "future''s end"
    [X] i also added some other string replacements for other cases which could mess the script up
[X] remove "trekdag_playlist" prefix
[X] make date field obligatory (bc of naming change)
[X] frontend checking config if there's something odd
[ ] autosave and load from localstorage or from file (invisibly). Maybe allow manual save and manual load from file.
    [ ] can be a little popup in the corner notifying you that last config is able to be loaded
[ ] have a preview button and window (that might open after clicking export) 
    [ ] make preview nicely formatted and clearly showing the blocks
[ ] show blocks in editor
[ ] if possible, maybe be able to cancel export (maybe a dialog thats there while exporting and it will check if thats been closed or something and then canceling)
[ ] screenshot button so you can share and so poeple can verify (you can just screenshot yourself for the time being)
